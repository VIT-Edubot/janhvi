##Structure and Organization
- **Header (`<header>`)**: Displays the title "User Feedback Form".
- **Navigation (`<nav>`)**: Contains placeholder links for navigation.
- **Main Content (`<section>` within `<article>`)**: Contains the feedback form, including:
  - Text input for the userâ€™s name.
  - Email input for user contact.
  - Radio buttons for satisfaction feedback.
  - Dropdown select for choosing the preferred feature.
  - Text area for additional comments.
  - Submit button to send feedback.
- **Media Embedding (`<video>` and `<audio>`)**: Provides an introduction to the new features.
- **Footer (`<footer>`)**: Displays a copyright notice.
## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Ensuring Proper Form Validation**:
   - Used `required` attributes for essential inputs.
   - Implemented `pattern` validation where necessary.
2. **Ensuring Accessibility**:
   - Used `<label>` elements associated with each input.
   - Included fallback text for unsupported media.
3. **Maintaining Semantic Structure**:
   - Used appropriate `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` elements.
This project demonstrates knowledge of HTML forms, semantic elements, and media embedding.
